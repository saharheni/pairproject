Hello everyone
Today, my colleague sahar tabka and I, will present to you our project called "Titos delivery Pizza"
So first of all, our plan contains a small introduction, second, we'll explain why we chose this subject.
Third, you'll watch a 1 minute video that explains the project. 
Also, the challenges faced during work
Then, we finish with a conclusion


So, we built this website where everyone can order his customized pizza and the reasons behind it (Why...)
-all of you are at home, work or anywhere and you don't have time to cook, the easiest way for you is to visit the website 
and order something delicious and customized 
-there is no waste of time: for example here at RBK we don't have enough time to prepare our meal 
specially when we have projects we can continue working until our order arrives
-And of course wherever you are Titos pizza will serve you



To summarize all this,
